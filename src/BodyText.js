      ; is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry
      Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of
      four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. The
      series began in 1983 with The Colour of Magic and continued until the
      final novel The Shepherd's Crown, which was published in 2015, following
      Pratchett's death. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from
      classic works, usually fantasy or science fiction, as well as mythology,
      folklore and fairy tales, and often use them for satirical parallels with
      cultural, political and scientific issues.

      or refuses to acknowledge it despite it definitely being there ðŸ¦†.</div>
